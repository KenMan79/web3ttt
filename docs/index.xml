      <description>Set up Install a local server Ganache is a great GUI for quickly spinning up an easily usable local blockchain in just a few clicks. This is the recommended route for this course, since we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to spend a lot of time helping everyone get a more complicated solution up and running.</description>

      <description>What is a testnet? Recall that smart contracts deployments are irreversible: once you deploy a contract, it&amp;rsquo;s on the network for good. Code added to the blockchain is immutable and cannot be modified.</description>
