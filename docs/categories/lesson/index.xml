      <description>Set up Install a local server Ganache is a great GUI for quickly spinning up an easily usable local blockchain in just a few clicks. This is the recommended route for this course, since we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to spend a lot of time helping everyone get a more complicated solution up and running.</description>

      <title>06 - Deploying to Testnet</title>
