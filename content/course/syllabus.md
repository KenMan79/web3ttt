## Instruction

This course is entirely remote. This course consists of one 45-minute intro session and six weeks of regular instruction. Synchronous class meetings will occur twice-a-week, consisting of approximately 1.5 hours of instruction and 0.5 hours of activity each.

Student work in this course will be reviewed, but not graded, and the certificate of completion is not awarded contingent on any level of performance.

This course is _not_ slow-moving. It starts with the basics but will be moving quickly.

Lessons will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube. <!-- TODO: Where will these be uploaded? -->

## Project

Students will complete a web3 project during this course. The planning for this project should start during [topic 2]({{< relref "/course/02-exploring-smart-contracts/index.md" >}}), and project development should continue until [topic 6]({{< relref "/course/06-deploying-to-testnet" >}}), when the project should be ready for deployment and presentation before the class.

## Topics

Note: These are tentative and still subject to change as the course is under development.

- Intro Session - 45 minute - Web3 Appreciation
- Topic 1 - Clone, edit, deploy applications. Taking pre-existing open-source decentralized applications and giving a broad overview, while examining their structure and deployment model.
- Topic 2 - How do you design these systems? Mechanics of deployment.
- Topic 3 - Creating something new. Basics of front-end web programming, writing contracts (Solidity or Vyper), integrating with nodes, communication, interaction, transacting, etc.
- Topic 4 - Deploying to testnet. Hosting the front-end and getting it hooked up. Deploying (to mainnet?) and contract versioning.
- Topic 5 - Beginning the designing and building of a web3 distributed application dev course of their own. Working with sample course materials provided by the course.
- Topic 6 - Soft skills. How to hold a workshop, how to market/advertise. "Inverted workshop" day wherein students instruct other students or the instructors so that they can practice teaching while still under the supervision of the course.
