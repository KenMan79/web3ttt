## That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully finished Web3T3! That's no small feat.

Let's review what we have accomplished together.

### Project

Your project can serve as an example for future learners to study and learn from. If you bring it to mainnet, it will bolster the entire ecosystem. Since you built the application and know it very well, it can serve as a teaching tool for you as well.

### Teaching Materials

Your per-session, topical micro-presentations can be modified for use in a workshop of your own. You already have experience presenting the material, now all you need to do is find a new audience!

### Community

This is not the end! Everyone at BAF wants to hear from you and support you in your future endeavors. Let us know how things are going and if you need any help. Please keep in touch with your fellow participants and the course staff!

## "Homework"

Instead of preparing a topical micro-presentation for this session, compose a rough action plan for re-sharing what we have covered by holding your own workshop or class.

Here are some ideas:

- Propose to hold a workshop (or series of workshops!) through your university's blockchain club to deep-dive into dapp development.
- Hold a hackathon or work with organizers of an existing event to hold a breakout session there.
- Become a presenter at a local tech conference or meetup.
- BAF has [resources](https://blockchainacceleration.org/programs) to help universities develop accredited blockchain courses, hold hackathons and conferences, etc.

Be prepared to share your plan with the rest of the class.
