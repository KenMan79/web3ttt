## Deploying to Testnet

How to deploy our smart contracts to the Rinkeby testnet

---

Different types of Ethereum networks:

- Local (Ganache, Geth, OpenEthereum, etc.)
- Test (Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan, GÃ¶rli, etc.)
- Main (only one)

---

**Why deploy to a testnet?**

---

Test your dapp before release!

Smart contracts are immutable once deployed

---

We'll be using the Rinkeby testnet

Instead of PoW or PoS, Rinkeby is a proof-of-authority network

---

**Proof-of-Authority**

Uses predetermined trusted entities to reach consensus

Pros? Cons?

---

### Obtaining free Ether on Rinkeby

---

### Deploying from Remix with MetaMask

---

### Deploying our Truffle project with Infura

## Project Status Update

Deploy your dapp on a testnet and show it off to the class!
