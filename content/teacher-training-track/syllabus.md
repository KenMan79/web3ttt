## Instruction

This course is entirely remote. This course consists of one 45-minute intro session and six weeks of regular instruction. Synchronous class meetings will occur twice-a-week, consisting of approximately 1.5 hours of instruction and 0.5 hours of activity each.

Student work in this course will be reviewed, but not graded, and the certificate of completion is not awarded contingent on any level of performance.

This course is _not_ slow-moving. It starts with the basics but will be moving quickly.

Lessons will be recorded and uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClN34KJfDsCVRs8rJHXH_-A).

## Project

Students will complete a web3 project during this course. The planning for this project should start during [topic 2]({{< relref "/teacher-training-track/02-exploring-smart-contracts/index.md" >}}), and project development should continue until [topic 6]({{< relref "/teacher-training-track/06-deploying-to-testnet" >}}), when the project should be ready for deployment and presentation before the class.
